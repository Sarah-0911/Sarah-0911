## Hi there 👋 I'm Sarah

🎯 Front-end developer with a strong eye for detail and a passion for clean, user-friendly interfaces.

💻 I mainly work with **React**, **Next.js**, and **TypeScript**, and I enjoy crafting front-end architectures that are both robust and elegant.

🎨 With a creative background, I bring a design-sensitive approach to development — bridging the gap between UI/UX and code.

🤝 Open to collaboration, freelance missions, or simply connecting with other tech enthusiasts!
